## Projects and Repositories 

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:
### Cybersecurity Related:

- **[Intrusion Detection System using Python](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/IoT_IDS)** `IDS` `IPS` `Python`
  <br> A Python-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to detect and block brute force attacks on a Raspberry Pi. This lightweight and efficient tool monitors live network traffic, detects malicious activity, and logs incidents for analysis.

- **[Ethical Hacking Home Lab](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/Ethical-Hacking-Home-Lab)** `Active Directory` `Windows Hardening` `User Group Policy` `Attacking and Defending AD` 
  <br> Built a home lab to simulate attacking and defending Active Directory environments, focusing on penetration testing and defence techniques.

- **[Risk Assessment for Instagram](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/Course-Project-Risk-Assessment-Report)** `Risk Assessment` `Risk Register` 
  <br> Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of Instagram, identifying critical vulnerabilities and proposing actionable security improvements.

### Others:
- **[Virtual Pizza Ordering Program](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/Virtual-Pizza-Ordering-Program)** `Python`  
  Developed a Python-based pizza ordering system simulation that allows users to customize orders, track inventory, and receive real-time updates.

- **[Finance Management Software (BudgetMaster)](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/Finance-Tracking)** `Java` 
  <br> Created a personal finance management tool in Java to help users track income, and expenses, and set budgeting goals, focusing on data visualization and user interaction.

- **[Medical Health Records Manager](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/Medical-Health-Records-Management)** `Java`
  <br> Designed a Java program that converts sensor health data into standardized formats for analysis, contributing to more accurate medical record-keeping.

- **[Web Design Project](https://github.com/AmeenMS03/WebDesignProject)** `HTML` `CSS` `JS`
